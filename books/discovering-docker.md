*Discovering Docker* is the perfect book to get started with Docker. With it, you will understand what is <a href="http://docker.com/">Docker</a>, how it works, and how it can be useful for you. The book covers everything you need to know to get started with Docker, from building images to orchestrating containers, including basic networking and service discovery.

You will then be able to leverage the power of Docker for your every day tasks, like building your own Docker images, setting up development environment, easily running continuous integration in separated containers, etc.
