Today, I am releasing [La Constitution](http://la-constitution.fr/).

I'm not sure I can even call that a project, because it is so tiny it took me barely one hour to make. But it is something that matters to me. It is also somewhat relevant to the current events, with everyone speaking about freedom and speech, republican values and so on.

A few months ago, for a reason I have now forgotten, I set out to read [the constitution of the french republic](http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/connaissance/constitution.asp). Turns out, even though it is very easy to find, I found it hard to read. The typography and layout really make this harder than it should.

So I decided to make my own version of the constitution. It is nicely formatted and I find it way more readable than the original, I hope you do too.

This micro-project is not a technical achievement in itself, but it's the beginning of something bigger for me. In [my *Level up* post](/level-up.html), I told you about how I was going to work on more meaningful projects. Well there it is. This might not be much, but **it means a lot to me**.

It is also the embodiment of a mindset I want to put myself in for 2015:

**Always be shipping.**

Even if that's only a tiny piece of a small something, shipping puts you in the right mood for, well, continuing to ship. In this respect, La Constitution paves the ground for a series of articles and projects that I hope to release at a steady pace this year.

In the meantime, why don't you go [read the constitution](http://la-constitution.fr/)?
