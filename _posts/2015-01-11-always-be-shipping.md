Today, I am releasing [La Constitution](http://la-constitution.fr/).

I'm not sure I can even call that a project, because it is so tiny it took me barely one hour to make. But it is something that matters to me. It is also somewhat relevant to the current events, with everyone speaking about freedom and speech, republican values and so on.

A few months ago, for a reason I have now forgotten, I set out to read [the constitution of the french republic](http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/connaissance/constitution.asp). Turns out, even though it is very easy to find, I found it hard to read. The typography and layout really make this harder to read than it should.

So I decided to make my own version of the constitution. It is nicely formatted and I find it way more readable than the original, I hope you do too.

This micro-project is not a technical achievement in itself, but it's the beginning of something bigger for me. In [my *Level up* post](/level-up.html), I told you about how I was going to work on more meaningful projects. Well there it is. This might not be much, but **it means a lot to me**.

It is also the embodiment of a mindset I want to put myself in for 2015:

**Always be shipping.**

Even if that's only a tiny piece of a small something, shipping puts you in the right mood for, well, continuing to ship. In this respect, La Constitution paves the ground for a series of projects I have for this year, which I hope to release at a steady pace.

The great thing with baby steps is that they are easy to take but still bring you somewhere. It is that somewhere that you need to keep in mind, while marking out the way with steps you can easily take.

For example, there's still a lot to do with [La Constitution](http://la-constitution.fr/), I'm planning on adding a JSON API and fulltext search using Elasticsearch. That would make it much more useful, but that would also make it unreleased, since the task would be way bigger. Instead, here what I did: I settled with the very first vision I've had of the website: *a human-readable version of the constitution*. And here it is. All the other features were added later in my mind,  as in *wouldn't it be cool if...*. Yes, it would be cool to have a JSON API for the constitution. Yes, it would be cool to be able to fulltext-search the constitution. But that's not the thing I envisioned. So I stuck to it, added whatever feature didn't take more than 5 minutes (the Markdown I already had, and the PDF was just a *Print > Save as PDF* away, and I released.

Incidentally, making La Constitution allowed me to work on another completely unrelated project (that is not ready for prime-time, but that you might have noticed if you're following me on GitHub *wink wink*), and it was also my first contact with [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) â€“ that I'm going to replace bootstrap with in my next projects. The next iterations will make me work on even more new (for me) technologies ([Go](http://golang.org/), [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/), and, less new, [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/)).

Of course, these will be baby-steps too. Go and Rust I will use to parse Markdown and output JSON. In case you're wondering why I would need two languages for this, I don't. I am just going to implement this in both language, just so I can get a grasp of them both. These will effectively be my first programs in Go and Rust. I've had a few ideas already to experiment with Go, but I never went to it because the task was so daunting I always procrastinated them (e.g.: implement stage1's workers in Go). Now parsing Markdown and outputting JSON? Yeah, that's something I can easily do in one hour or less, even in a language I've never used.

And that's another thing I want to set in motion this year: **learning by doing**. I have been postponing learning a lot of things, just because the task seemed daunting. The solution to this is simple: start doing something. Small things, that you can build upon. This is such an important subject that it totally deserves its very own article, so expect some more about it very soon!

In the meantime, why don't you go [read the constitution](http://la-constitution/)?
