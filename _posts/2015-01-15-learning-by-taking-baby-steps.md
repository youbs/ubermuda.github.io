title: Learning by taking baby steps
---

Another thing I want to do more this year: **learning by doing**.

I have been postponing learning a lot of things, just because the task seemed daunting. Learning a new language. Learning a new technology. Learning so much things. The solution to this is simple: start doing something. Small things, that you can build upon. That's the great thing with baby steps is that they are easy to take but still bring you somewhere. It is that somewhere that you need to keep in mind, while marking out the way with steps you can easily take.

For example, there's still a lot to do with [La Constitution](http://la-constitution.fr/). I was planning on adding a JSON API and full-text search using Elasticsearch. That would have made it much more useful, but that would have also made it unreleased, since the task would have been way bigger, so big that it wouldn't be finished yet. Instead, here's what I did: I settled with the very first vision I've had of the website: *a human-readable version of the constitution*. And here it is. All the other features were added later in my mind,  as in *wouldn't it be cool if...*. Yes, it would be cool to have a JSON API for the constitution. Yes, it would be cool to be able to full-text search the constitution. But that's not the thing I envisioned. So I stuck to it, added whatever feature didn't take more than 5 minutes (the Markdown I already had, and the PDF was just a *Print > Save as PDF* away), and I released.

Incidentally, making [La Constitution](http://la-constitution.fr/) allowed me to work on another completely unrelated project (that is not ready for prime-time, but that you might have noticed if you're following me on GitHub *wink wink*), and it was also my first contact with [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) â€“ that I'm going to replace bootstrap with in my next projects. The next iterations will make me work on even more new (for me) technologies ([Go](http://golang.org/), [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/), and, less new, [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/)).

Of course, these will be baby-steps too. Go and Rust I will use to parse Markdown and output JSON. In case you're wondering why I would need two languages for this, I don't. I am just going to implement this in both language, just so I can get a grasp of them both. These will effectively be my first programs in Go and Rust. I've had a few ideas already to experiment with Go, but I never went to it because the task was so daunting I always procrastinated them (e.g.: implement stage1's workers in Go). Now parsing Markdown and outputting JSON? Yeah, that's something I can easily do in one hour or less, even in a language I've never used.
