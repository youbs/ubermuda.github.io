Yesterday I pushed an update to my [Discovering Docker book](/books/discovering-docker.html) in the form of a few typos fixes and, more importantly, an entire new chapter called *Managing containers*. Here's the table of content for this new chapter:

* Inspecting a container
* Container lifecycle
* Entering a container
* Checking processes
* Exporting and importing containers
* Restart policies

As you can see, it covers everything you need to manage your containers from birth to death.

Because Docker is a rapidly evolving technology, anything written about it has a great chance of rapidly becoming obsolete, and *Discovering Docker* is no exception. That is why I am planning regular updates to the book.

The current plan is to keep updates coming at the rate of one new chapter per month until I run out of content (I currently have at least 5 new chapters in my backlog â€“ all thanks to the amazing feedback of my amazing readers).

Each monthly update will also be the occasion to update existing content and keep it up to date. This way you can be confident that your knowledge of Docker stays up to date.

The Discovering Docker book is [available for sale](/books/discovering-docker.html) for the amazing price of $9. That's $9 for a book that keeps getting better every month, so what are you waiting for?
